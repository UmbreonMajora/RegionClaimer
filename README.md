# Region Claimer
This is a minecraft spigot plugin developed for the minecraft server ardania.de by UmbreonMajora

## Commands:
/rc - Allows you to claim a region.

## Permissions:
RegionClaim.claim - Allows users to use the /rc command.

## Restrictions:
- A user can only have one region in the size of 50x50 blocks.
- If there is already a region nearby, the process will fail.
- If the user has already one region where he's the owner, the process will fail.

# Additional:
- Plugin will place a block of your choice at the corners of the region.
- You can decide the size of the regions by your own, by using the config file.
- All messages are customizable by changing them in the config.
- If no config can be found, the plugin will use the default settings I set up for ardania.de.
